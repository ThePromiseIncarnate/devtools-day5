# Web Debugging and Optimization Exercise

## Overview

This exercise is designed to improve your skills in web debugging and optimization. You will be working with an intentionally flawed web application. Your task is to identify and document the problems in the provided HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

## Instructions

Copy this README.md into your Devtools REPO in a new MD file called Day-5.md

### Step 1: Identify Problems

Go through the provided files (`index.html`, `style.css`, and `app.js`). Each file contains several marked problems (indicated by comments like `<!-- Problem 1: -->`, `/* Problem 5: */`, etc.). Your task is to identify what each problem is and why it is an issue.

### Step 2: Document Each Problem

In this README.md file, document each problem. Write a sentence for each problem explaining what the issue is and why it's problematic. Use the format below for your documentation:

#### Problem 1:

- Description: No meta data.

#### Problem 2:

- Description: CSS in wrong place.

#### Problem 3:

- Description: '.inline-style' isn't used.

#### Problem 4:

- Description: Image has no alt text.

#### Problem 5:

- Description: Uses third-party cookies.

#### Problem 6:

- Description: Superfluous "!important" in CSS.

#### Problem 7:

- Description: Image is improperly sized!

#### Problem 8:

- Description: Unused CSS.

#### Problem 9:

- Description: N/A

#### Problem 10:

- Description: $ is not defined
    at HTMLDocument anonymous. Block of code isn't used.

### Step 3: Propose Solutions

For each identified problem, propose a solution or an optimization strategy. Briefly describe how you would fix the issue.

#### Problem 1:

- Solution: Add meta data. 

#### Problem 2:

- Solution: Move CSS above title.

#### Problem 3:

- Solution: Delete unused CSS.

#### Problem 4:

- Solution: Add alt text. 

#### Problem 5:

- Solution: Reduce third-party cookies by serving some files myself.

#### Problem 6:

- Solution: Remove the superfluous "!important" in CSS.

#### Problem 7:

- Solution: Change the size.

#### Problem 8:

- Solution: Remove unused CSS.

#### Problem 9:

- Solution: N/A

#### Problem 10:

- Solution: Delete unused JavaScript. 

### Step 4: Reflect

This was a very difficult and tedious assignment, that just leaves me feeling like there's basically no point to fixing any of this stuff unless it's actually required? 

## Submission

Submit this README.md file with all the problems documented and solved, along with your reflection. Ensure that your explanations are clear and concise.

This exercise is an opportunity to practice critical web development skills. Pay close attention to detail and think about how each issue affects the overall performance and user experience of the web application.
